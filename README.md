# Install

Here is the list of libraries you need to install to execute the code:
- python = 3.6
- [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) = 0.4
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- jupyter

All of them can be installed via `conda` (`anaconda`), e.g.
```
conda install jupyter
```

## Running the code locally

This project is adopted from the DIP project, so it contains some of its notebooks. However, we only modified and used the following files:

To run the image preprocessing, run create_noisy_images_modified.ipynb

To run the training process, run denoising-modified.ipynb

## Google Colab

To run it using Google Colab, click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/charliexu07/CS2529_Project) and select the notebook to run. Remember to uncomment the first cell to clone the repository into colab's environment.
